  In otherwords, it's a def version of the memoize function.

  Memoized functions are similar to normal functions, but can be more performant in certain circumstances.
  They basically keep a record of each arguments and their return value,
  so if a function is called with the same arguements twice, it will run through the calculations the first time,
  cache the result, and the second time it'll just return the cached result without running the function again.

  Of course, this means that this function has to be a pure function,
  which means that it has no side effects (no setters, etc.), and doesn't rely on mutable external values,
  such that it always returns the same thing if called with the same arguements.

  You can read more about this at clojure.org docs under the \"memoize\" function."
